# vagrant_ex

Here are some simple vagrantfiles that we looked at in class.

test 01 is the default Vagrantfile that is generated when you run 

'''
vagrant init ubuntu/focal64
'''

test 02 is modified to contatin two nodes (primary and secondary)

test 03 shows you how to include a shell script to perform per node configuration (it is unfinished!)
